Never in my life would I have thought this would be something I would do:
Make a blog...

Apparently it's what the cool kids in the web development world do and I want so badly to be a cool kid too!

There will be lots of different blogs about tech, best practices, and things that I have found along my journey to become an employed web developer. I plan to start my own web series on YouTube shortly and will link the content on this website. There will also be cool little video/screen casts brought to you by: [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/).

There will also be videos...lots and lots of videos! Mostly about coding; but I will not rule out any amazing videos like this one!

Thanks for stopping by and look for more content soon!
